* Problems

Problems that Zach Beane and Mark Evenson have with how Quicklisp and
ASDF interact identified during #sbcl20 in Vienna, December 2019.

** (Xach) compile warnings should not always be fatal conditionally

*** (Xach)
<https://twitter.com/xach/status/1204038946503741440?s=20>
To simplify: I want to establish a dynamic environment (variables and
handler binds) around each call to LOAD-SYSTEM, including
recursively. I haven't found a way yet.

*** Problem transcription (easye)
We need to define a predicate for the recursive transversal of the
planned ASDF graph that allows us to select restarts for whether any
given section of the build machinery fails, and signals a condition.  

*** Demonstration of problem (Xach)

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
   #p"<file:warno.asd>"
#+END_SRC

*** TODO construct predicate

** (easye) :DEFSYSTEM-DEPENDS-ON clauses should use Quicklisp network load transparently

Involves patching <https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-client>.

Zach's work on this can be seen in <https://github.com/quicklisp/ddo-bug>.

** (ECL) should be able to use ASDF without UIOP

For distribution packaging in some CL implementations, the presence of UIOP should not be required.  

*** TODO (easye) possible solution: figure out how to "undo" the use of UIOP

Possibly dynamically construct a facade for UIOP which "does enough"
for what the packaging process does.



** (everyone) I shouldn't care that Quicklisp uses ASDF2

Tell us what doesn't work for you.
