* Problems

Problems that Zach Beane and Mark Evenson have with how Quicklisp and
ASDF interact.

** (Xach) compile warnings should not always be fatal conditionally
<https://lispblog.xach.com/post/104872127228/a-verbosity-conundrum>

We need to define a predicate for the recursive transversal of the
planned ASDF graph that allows us to select restarts for whether any
given section of the build machinery fails, and signals a condition.  

*** Demonstration of problem (Xach)

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
   #p"<file:warno.asd>"
#+END_SRC


*** TODO construct predicate

** (easye) :DEFSYSTEM-DEPENDS-ON clauses should use Quicklisp network load transparently

Involves patching <https://github.com/quicklisp/quicklisp-client>.

** (everyone) I shouldn't care that Quicklisp uses ASDF2

Really.  Stop bitchin': tell us what doesn't work for you.
